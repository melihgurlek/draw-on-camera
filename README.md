# draw-on-camera

Little program made with opencv and python.
It basically recognizes the object's color you're holding and draws on the camera in the same color starting from the tip of the object. <br />
Now that i think of it i could've made it with C++ but it is what it is. <br />
It currently only recognizes two colors dark blue and neon pink. Because they were the most unique colors i can find in my house. <br />
It has problems like you have to hold the object perpendicular to ground otherwise it draws somewhere on the air. <br />
